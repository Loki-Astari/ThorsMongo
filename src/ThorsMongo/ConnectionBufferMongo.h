/*
 * The ConnectionBufferMongo understands that communication is done in message blocks.
 * The format of the message includes the size of the message in the first 4 bytes.
 * Also that the minimum message size is 26 bytes.
 *      MessageHeader:      16 bytes.
 *      MessageInfo:
 *          Flags           4 bytes.
 *          Kind            1 bytes
 *          BSON doc                    5 bytes min
 *              size        4 bytes
 *              terminator  1 byte
 *                      -----
 *                         26 bytes.
 *
 * Reading:
 *      So if we are not in a message this will force underflow to get the message block.
 *      So underflow()
 *          We read the size of the message.
 *          This will block.
 *          Once we have the size we will try and read the full the message.
 *          This full read will not block if we can't read the full message.
 *          But will block to make sure the underlying read operation will complete.
 *              i.e. You tried to read 8 bytes of data and trying to read the message
 *                   only returned 6 bytes it will block until you have all 8.
 *          Note:
 *              Because we don't block on a full read we may read a partial message.
 *              This means that underflow() may be called again when we need more data.
 *              If this happens we will always try and read (non blocking) the rest of
 *              the message, but will block to make sure the underlying read can complete.
 *
 *          We use the "underflowNeeds" to communicate the minimum number of bytes needed.
 *
 *      The xsgetn() is overridden to allow for efficiency.
 *          This will call underflow() if more data is needed.
 *          But this will always copy data into the buffer.
 *
 *          The reason for this is we need all the data in the buffer to perform
 *          a checksum check when the message is complete.
 *
 * Writing:
 *      When writing the full message is queued in the buffer and only flushed on sync().
 *      Trying to sync() before the message is complete is an error.
 *
 *      This is need to allow us to compute the checksum value.
 *      Also this will (next version) allow us to compress the output message.
